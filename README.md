Repository on getting the Power 2 Max power meter connected to the ant+ garmin usb dongle and writing data to the command line.

# Getting Started
Essentially follows the installation of the [ant-plus library](https://github.com/Loghorn/ant-plus) on javascript. However, the following are the steps that I took to get it working.
